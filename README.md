# Computational-Musicology
## please don't show this portfolio in class (yet)

In the course Computational Musicology we have to choose a corpus that allows for a meaningful comparison between musical tracks. I hear more and more that artists are increasingly inspired by classical music, so for this assignment, it seems interesting to me to compare classical music with pop and dance music. The research question I will try to answer in this portfolio is: In what way does classical music express itself in pop and dance music? 

I will use 2 sorts of playlists:
One with classical music and one with pop and dance music.
(Still have to figure out what and how many songs)

An example of a track that I will probably use is FÃ¼r Elise from Beethoven. 

I still need to determine what features I am going to look at. Probably timbre and pitch classes and maybe some other features turn out to be interesting
