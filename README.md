# Sprinters vs Long-distance swimmers


## Introduction 
Let me introduce myself. My name is Tessa, and I am a professional athlete. I swim in the national team and have won several national and international medals. 

During competitions I listen to music that inspires and motivates me. So, for me and a lot of my team mates, music plays an important role in the optimal race preperation. 

In swimming there are different diciplines. More specificly there are sprinters, and long-distance swimmers. Sprinters exert maximum effort for a short period of time, often no longer than 30 seconds. A long-distance swimmer does not have to be so explosive, and the exertion of their race usually lasts more than two minutes. 

Of course not all swimmers lissten to music during their preperantion, but in my experience there are both sprinters and long-distance swimmers who have special playlists for competitions. 

## Research question

Since sprinters and long distance differ so much from each other in terms of performances, the research question I will try to answer in this portfolio is: 

**What are the differences between the motivation playlists of sprinters and long-distance swimmers?**


## Playlists 

For this portfolio, I used several playlists of my teammates. I have subdivided these playlists in two groups, namely a playlist with tracks that sprinters listen to and one that long-distance swimmers listen to. 

**Typical tracks for sprinters:**

* lakdjal
* lajdjla

**Typical tracks for long-distance swimmers:**
* asda
* ;kjakdf
